# CodeCanvas: Pixelate Your Logic

## Introduction

CodeCanvas is a versatile code image generator designed to convert code snippets into visually appealing images. Whether you're a developer looking to share code snippets on social media, a teacher creating educational materials, or a blogger illustrating programming concepts, CodeCanvas simplifies the process by transforming your code into eye-catching images.

## How It Works

CodeCanvas converts code snippets into images by pixelating the code. Each character in the code snippet is represented by a colored pixel, creating a visual representation of the code. The resulting image can be customized with various settings such as color themes, font styles, and image dimensions.
